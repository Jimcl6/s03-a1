	<h3>PREAMBLE</h3>

	<p>
		The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction. The clauses that are inluded in the full version
		give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.
